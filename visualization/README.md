# Visualization

Utilities for visualizing knowledge graphs.

For now, we use a purely Python-based approach using [pyvis](https://pypi.org/project/pyvis/) to generate a static HTML page displaying the graph.
Out of the approaches listed in [Visualizing Networks in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-networks-in-python-d70f4cbeb259), this is the most attractive approach.
However, it still leaves much to be desired.

A more likely future direction would be a webpage that uses more versatile JavaScript-based packages to display a graph served dynamically from some backend.
Such an approach would allow a user to interact with a graph remotely.
