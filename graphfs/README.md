# Graph File System

GraphFS allows local files to act as vertices in a knowledge graph.
Arranging files this way avoids imposing any particular heirarchy on the files that would arise in a classical directory-based file system.

The first target use of this system is to solve a common modern-day pain point: indexing a sprawling collection of personal photos.
