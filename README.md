# GraphCal

GraphCal will be an experimental personal calendar system that helps you remember the past, present, and future better than any other tool available. It will follow a graph-first approach, unlike the misguided Markdown-with-links formats of Notion, Obsidian, Logseq, and others. Every piece of information in GraphCal is represented as vertices and edges in the knowledge graph itself, making it fully accessible to whatever plugins we eventually build on top.

## Interface

In the ideal future, GraphCal is everywhere you are, even in the shower.

For now, it will start humble: a command line interface. From here, we can add

1. graph visualization
1. voice user interface
1. brain-computer interface
